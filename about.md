Hi and thanks for checking out my site. I&#8217;ve been a web developer for over 15 years now and I started this site to give out information about the industry and some helpful pieces of code that anyone can use in their projects. I primarily use Laravel, AngularJS, CodeIgniter, jQuery, MySQL, and other technoligies/languages for my projects, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be posting about.

Thanks again for stopping by,  
-Chris
