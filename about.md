Hi and thanks for checking out my site. I&#8217;ve been a web developer for over 13 years now and I started this site to give out information about the industry and some helpful pieces of code that anyone can use in their projects. I primarily use CodeIgniter, Laravel, jQuery, MySQL, and CSS/HTML for my projects, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be posting about.

Keep an eye out for new posts shortly.

Thanks again for stopping by,  
-Chris
