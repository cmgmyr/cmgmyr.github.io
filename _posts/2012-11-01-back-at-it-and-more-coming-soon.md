Hello all,  
Thank you for keeping an eye on my blog. I really like being able to help other coders and programmers out there with web development. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t posted anything in quite a while, so I apologize for that. I&#8217;ve been messing around with some new things that I will be posting about very soon. Just so I don&#8217;t keep you on the edge of your seat<!--more--> for too long, here is a quick list of things to look forward to. If you would like to see anything specific on my blog, feel free to leave a comment below.

The upcoming list:

  * <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> &#8211; Intro, Use Cases, and Examples
  * Web Development + Dropbox
  * The (possible) move to Apple from PC
  * Setting up a Linux server at home with a media server, VPN, and more
  * <a href="http://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a> &#8211; a newer PHP framework
  * Version control with Mercurial and Git
  * Random business thoughts & feelings
  * Plus more!

Thanks and stay tuned!
