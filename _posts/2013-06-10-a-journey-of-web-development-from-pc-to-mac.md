At the end of 2012 I found myself pretty fed up with the PC world, and jealous that so many things were so much easier on the Mac/OSX platform. Just simple tasks through the command line are harder on PC, or you would even need additional programs to run them. <!--more-->For example, having to run Pageant on PC just to make your SSH keys work for GitHub/BitBucket. Well, add up a lot of those annoyances, problems with synching to/from my iPhone 5, and other things I decided to make the switch.

**I ended up getting:**

  * 15&#8243; MacBook Pro Retina with 2.6GHz Intel Core i7, with turbo boost up to 3.6GHz, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD
  * 27&#8243; Thunderbolt Widescreen monitor
  * Wireless Keyboard
  * Wireless Trackpad
  * Super Drive

The first thing that I initially noticed was the speed of this machine. It is nothing less than amazingly blazing fast! You click on a program and it instantly comes up, not just the &#8220;welcome&#8221; screen&#8230;the whole app. After a little while you get more used to it, but it&#8217;s really evident when jump back on the PC to do something and you have to wait a few more seconds (which seems like forever).

As with all PC to Mac conversions, there were a number of programs that I had to get in order to keep my workflow as similar as I could. The last thing that I wanted to do was to learn a new OS and a bunch of new software.

**PC & Mac Compatible Software:**

  * NetBeans &#8211; used only when needed, a little bulky but I like their code formatting option.
  * Adobe Creative Cloud &#8211; have this installed on my PC and Mac. If you haven&#8217;t signed up for this&#8230;you need to
  * Navicat for MySQL
  * Microsoft Office &#8211; Mostly Word/Excel
  * Quickbooks &#8211; a little different on Mac, but I was able to convert most of my stuff. Just had to rebuild some reports

**How about you, have you made the switch from PC to Mac recently? What other tools/programs do you use?**
