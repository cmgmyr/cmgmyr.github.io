It's been on my to-do list for quite a while now: move away from Wordpress to Jekyll.<!--more--> Everyone pretty much has the same reasons of why they've made this move:

* Wordpress is too bulky, usually loads slowly
* Tired of running security updates
* Can't make customizations easily
* Can't run/test locally without messing with the database a lot
* Would rather write in Markdown

...just to name a few.

A while ago I came across [Joshua Lande's post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) about creating a blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). This was essentially the same process that I wanted to take, and did.

I pretty just followed Joshua's process with a few tweaks of my own and also used a [Wordpress to Jekyll Exporter plugin](https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter) which did a lot of the hard work for me.

So far I can say that I'm pretty happy with the move to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Please take a look at my blog's [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/cmgmyr/cmgmyr.github.io) to see what I've done.
