Last night I was working on a little pet project of mine (soon to be a few blog posts probably), and I ran across a little problem.<!--more--> I've been playing with PadogaBox and set up a new app, made some commits, then decided to start over with my code and do something a little different. I've already set up my app through PB, so I didn't want to delete it, re-add it, then re-configure everything. All I really wanted to do is delete the "master" branch and push up my new code that I had worked on. To my surprise, since I've never done this before, it is actually pretty easy!
