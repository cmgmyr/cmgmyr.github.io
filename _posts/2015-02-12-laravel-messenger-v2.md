Just wanted everyone to know that [Laravel Messenger](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger) has been officially tagged V2 which is fully compatible with Laravel 5. <!--more--> V1 is still available for Laravel 4 and I will continue to support both versions.

Have any issues? Please [report them](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger/issues)
