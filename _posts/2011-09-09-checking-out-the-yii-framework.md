Sorry, I know that I haven&#8217;t posted in a while. I&#8217;ve just been pretty busy with client projects, personal projects, music, stuff around the house, and general &#8220;summer&#8221; stuff. I&#8217;m going to try to make it a point to write some more in the very near future.<!--more-->

For the past few months I&#8217;ve been keeping my eye on the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" target="_blank">Yii framework</a>. I&#8217;ve read a lot of great reviews of it and a lot of developers of all levels really like it a lot. I started looking into it more over the past week or so and started playing around with it. Between going through the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/screencasts/" target="_blank">video tutorials</a> and their <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/" target="_blank">intro guide</a>, it&#8217;s very easy to see that this framework is VERY powerful. I immediately saw a huge (positive) difference between Yii and CodeIgniter, which I have been using for the past 5 years or so.

CodeIgniter has been great to me, but I think it&#8217;s time to move on. It was very easy to learn and the community has been fairly helpful over the time that I&#8217;ve been with the framework. I feel that it hasn&#8217;t been moving forward fast enough compared to other frameworks and the &#8220;large scale&#8221; features are lacking. I&#8217;ll still be maintaining my current CI sites and scripts, but I&#8217;ve pretty much decided to move over to Yii.

I have a good deal of work ahead of my in order to port all of my CI code over to Yii, but it will be worth it once I&#8217;m done. Over the past week I&#8217;ve hit some bumps in the road trying to get Yii to function similarly to what I have in CI, but it&#8217;s coming along. I should have a lot of great posts soon about what I&#8217;m working on. In the mean time, here are some great pro&#8217;s of the Yii framework:

  * Full MVC design with PHP 5 support
  * Database Access Objects (DAO), Query Builder, Active Record, DB Migration
  * AJAX-enabled widgets
  * Authentication and authorization
  * Skinning and theming
  * Layered caching scheme
  * Automatic code generation
  * Great Security
  * Super <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/performance/" target="_blank">Performance</a>!
  * and much, much more.

Please stay tuned for more Yii blog posts. If you want to know anything specific about converting your CodeIgniter site to Yii, please leave a comment and let me know about it.
