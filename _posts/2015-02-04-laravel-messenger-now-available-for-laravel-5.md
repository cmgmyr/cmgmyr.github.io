[Laravel 5](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/562986210172616708) was announced today, so what better time to upgrade my [Laravel Messenger](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger) package!?! Current L5 changes are on the **develop** branch for the time being. <!--more-->This will be merged into master and tagged V2.0 as soon as I get a little more feedback and fix any potential issues.

Have any issues? Please [report them](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger/issues)

__UPDATE (2/12/15):__ The Laravel Messenger package has been tagged as V2, so there is no need to use the **develop** branch at this time.
