I made this as an extension to the Rackspace Cloudfiles API along with some changes to it. <!--more-->You can read the original blog post [here](http://www.modomediagroup.com/2010/06/rackspace-cloud-files-api-with-codeigniter/).

Right now this is just some basic functions, but I will be actively supporting this and adding things as I go along. If you have any requests or changes, please feel free to leave me a request in the issues tab for me.

I've made an easy to follow controller with a number of examples. If you need any other ones, please let me know.

## Installation

  1. Drop everything into your application folder
  2. Edit the config file
  3. Go to the controller and start playing around.

If you run into any problems with running it on your localhost or server, please make sure you check out the original API documentation [here](https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud).

Please visit the [GitHub](https://github.com/modomg/codeigniter-rackspace-cloudfiles/) repo to learn more.

Feel free to leave any feedback or feature requests. Thanks for checking out my library.
